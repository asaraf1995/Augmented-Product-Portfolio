# Augmented-Product-Portfolio

## Steps to run the project:
# Install Unity hub [from](https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download)
# Version of Unity Required for this project is 2019.2.11. You can download this version from [here](https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download/archive). 
# Click on the option "Unity Hub" for installing the version on Unity hub.
# Click on "Projects" in Unity hub and click on "Add" for adding the project to Unity hub.
# Click on the Project Name to open the project in Unity.

## Note: There is a file gitignore which doesn't allow upload and download of any Unity library and the command is "/[Ll]ibrary/".
## Hence, the user installing the folder has to import Vuforia manually to the Unity file.
## Refer this documentation for importing Vuforia in Unity [here](https://library.vuforia.com/articles/Training/getting-started-with-vuforia-in-unity.html)

# This project was designed and developed by Aastha Saraf and Akshay Narula.
