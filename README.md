# Augmented-Product-Portfolio

# This project was created by Aastha Saraf and Akshay Narula.

## Note: There is a file gitignore which doesn't allow upload and download of any Unity library and the command is "/[Ll]ibrary/".
## Hence, the user installing the folder has to import Vuforia manually to the Unity file.
## Refer this documentation for importing Vuforia in Unity [here] (https://library.vuforia.com/articles/Training/getting-started-with-vuforia-in-unity.html)
